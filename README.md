How to Make it Go
=================

Open index.html in Chrome, preferably.

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the camera to an orientation from which
you can actually see the scene. (I'm not sure why the start position is so
uncomfortable; I'd have to look and figure out how to change it. :)

Play with the form elements on the page to change the forcefield being
applied to the invisible box in the back-right, to change the constraint
solver being used on the "chain" in the front-middle, and to perform a few
other small scene modifications.
